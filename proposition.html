           <h2>What plan?</h2>
            <p>Financial constraints have forced Transfort to develop a new, optimized bus network. Drafting the plan was a year long project which began on November 2024 and involved two-way discussions with experts and major groups in the Fort Collins community. A turning point was reached late last October when Transfort higherups proposed their new plan to city council, which was met with both praise and constructive criticism.</p>
            <h2>What will change?</h2>
            <p>It will limit the service area and alter or cut underutilized routes. The only routes which are not already suspended and stand to be entirely cut are the 6, 9, and 92. Details about each route can be found on its own page, which is accessible from the links on the home page.</p>
            <h2>Anything new?</h2>
            <p>No entirely new routes will be introduced, but major changes (including possible name changes) will be coming. The 3 and 32 will be merged into a single route currently labeled the 3N which will stretch from the Campus Transit Center to the Foothills Shuttle station on Overland and Elizabeth. Additionally, the 18 route (currently labeled 18N) will be extended further south to connect to the 16 on Timberline and Harmony.</p>
            <h2>What now?</h2>
            <p>Now we enter the multi-phase integration of the plan, beginning with communication with the Fort Collins community. Information about this can be found at <a href="https://ourcity.fcgov.com/transfort-optimization-plan">ourcity.fcgov.com</a>, and some communication will be made by reversing the channels used to gather community feedback.</p>
