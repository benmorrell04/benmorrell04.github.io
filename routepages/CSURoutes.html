           <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The 2, 3 , 31, and 32 are all routes which extend Southwest from the Campus Transit Center. They allow for commutes to the university from students that live in the various apartments along Elizabeth and Prospect.</p>
            <p>The first two were a part of the set of original routes which were designed by a CSU graduate student. As accomodation for campus bus commuters increased with the 2002 construction of the Campus Transit Center, new routes like the 31 and 32 were added.</p>
            <p>They have served as periphreal routes for the MAX, with plans often floated to build a Bus Rapid Transit Route along the West Elizabeth cooridor. Under the optimized plan, these plans will somewhat manifest with the 3N - the new route which will replace the 3 and 32. Transfort hopes to eventually connect this new route directly to the MAX.</p>
