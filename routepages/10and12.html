           <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Route 10 connected the DTC, CSU, and City Park along Laporte and Mulberry. The 12 connected the South Transit Center to Foothills Mall before running east along Horsetooth to Ziegler road. Both routes are currently suspended and are not planned to be renewed within the optimized plan.</p>
            <p>The two routes were introduced in 2014 alongside a long-defunct route 20, the discontinuation of routes 1, 15, and 17 and a litany of other network tweaks. The changes were implemented as part of Transfort's switch to focus on their MAX BRT route.</p>
            <p>The 10's reasons for cancellation are fairly obvious - it shares most of its path with more effective routes. While the 12 had much more unique coverage, it still fell fate to low ridership.</p>
