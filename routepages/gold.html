           <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The Gold route enables safe late-night travel between Old Town, CSU, and apartments along Elizabeth and Prospect. It began service as two routes, the Green and Gold, in February 2012.</p>
            <p>The routes began as a campaign promise by 2011 ASCSU candidates Chase Eckerdt and Justin Sadafy. They would lose to Eric Berlinberg and Rachel Robertson, who would appoint Eckerdt to their cabinet as Director of Governmental Affairs. At this position, he kept developing and pushing a plan for late night buses which would be unanimously approved by city council in December.</p>
            <p>The first year of service was very successful, moving about 400 passengers per night of operation. After operations of the routes changed hands multiple times, the Green route was eventually dropped and the Gold would become fare free alongside all other routes in March 2020.</p>
            <p>The $34,000 of the $119,000 implementation was paid for by ASCSU and by extent CSU students. The rest was paid by Fort Collins Police Services, advertisement revenue, and a $1 fare which students were not able to waive.</p>
