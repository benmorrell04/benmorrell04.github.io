           <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The 19 route connects the Campus Transit Center to the South Transit Center via Shields. It intersects with several other routes and serves bussiness and housing along Shields.</p>
            <p>This route was once served by the 6, but the 19 was added during BRT expansion to run parrallel to the MAX and reach the STC.</p>
            <p>In a vote of confidence in the route and its performance, no adjustments were made to it for the optimization plan. While its currently reduced to only running once per hour, the new plan will see it labeled a core route which will run every 30 minutes during peak hours.</p>
