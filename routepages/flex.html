           <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Three routes currently share the FLEX label, each of which connect Fort Collins to southern cities. In response to financial withdrawal from the City of Loveland, they will be merged into a single route at the end of this year.</p>
            <p>The FLEX began in the late 1990s as the FoxTrot route, running between Fort Collins and Loveland. A June 2010 partnership saw the route extended south to add Berthoud and Longmont and renamed to the Fort Collins Loveland Express. It was again extended southbound to Boulder in January 2016, directly connecting Colorado's two biggest universities.</p>
            <p>Funding for the routes came from a variety of sources. This number was heightened by the number of cities involved, as each city contributed. The final expansion also brought involvement from CU and CSU as well as a grant from the Denver Regional Council of Governments.</p>
            <p>Financial constraints forced the city of Loveland to withdraw from the FLEX program. After 2025, they will replace the FLEX1 route with a new route operatied by City of Loveland Transit (COLT) which will run from their North Transit Center to Fort Collins South Transit Center.</p>
