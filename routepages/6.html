           <h2>Overview</h2>
           <p>Route 6 has ran west and south from CSU from the very start, with students and faculty having relied on it since the 1976 ASCSU and Transfort contract. It started by running South along Shields, but was pushed east to Taft Hill. Its Shields route has been replaced by the 19.</p>
           <p>The age of this route makes it more shocking that it was cut from the network in the optimized transit plan. Its replacement along Shields will stay, signaling that the changed route negatively impacted ridership.</p>
